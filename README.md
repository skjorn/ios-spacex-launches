# iOS Demo App

A demo iPhone application that displays past SpaceX launches retrieved from public REST API dedicated to SpaceX.

Initial specification: https://gist.github.com/Majkitos/5deecb8c7df4b23e1f092f05ff98adb9

REST API documentation: https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API
* Postman collection: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/2025350/RWaEzAiG

## Custom Requirements

There are no initial expectations as to what information to display for launch preview and detail, so additional design steps needed to be taken in order to narrow down the specification. Further decisions were informed by what's available in the API and by other apps, web sites and articles that provide similar information.

FIXME: Specify data needed for launch preview and detail...
